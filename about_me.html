    <h1>Melissa Skaluba</h1>
    <p>Last weekend, I took a trip to Sebago Lake in Maine with my closest friend and her family--something we do most weekends in the summer. We stayed in her guest house,  which overlooks the lake, spent our mornings at our favorite coffee shop, and spent the afternoons studying or working side by side. In the evenings, we joined her family for dinner before heading into Portland to explore the city. Although, this weekend was a little different than most because I hurt my elbow.</p>

    <h2>Favorite Restaurant</h2>
    <p>
        I'm not sure if an establishment needs chairs or even an indoor section to qualify as a restaurant, but right now my favorite spot is  <a href="https://www.thescoopnscootery.com" target="_blank">Scoop N Scootery</a>. I usually go to the Cambridge location since it is right next to my work. Their ice cream sundaes are incredible--my current top pics are <i>That Thicc Boi</i>, <i>Granddaddy</i>, and  <i>Demogorgon</i>.
